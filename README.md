## Flask: For building the web API.

## we use adjust_for_ambient_noise() to help the recognizer handle noisy environments. It "listens" to the noise in the background and adjusts its sensitivity before recording the actual speech.

## Now, let's discuss various methods and strategies to improve speech recognition accuracy:

 1 : Noise Reduction and Audio Preprocessing:

This method is like cleaning a dirty audio recording. Imagine trying to hear someone speak in a noisy market This method helps to remove that background noise.

Audio filtering: This is like using a strainer to remove unwanted sounds. It keeps the good speech sounds and throws away the bad noise.
Wiener filtering: This is a smart way to guess what the original speech sounded like before noise was added. It's like having a super-ear that can focus only on the speaker's voice.
Audio normalization: This makes sure all parts of the speech are equally loud. It's like adjusting the volume so you can hear whispers and shouts clearly.

2 : Custom Language Models:

This is like teaching the computer to understand specific ways of speaking. For example, if you're making a system for doctors, you'd teach it medical terms.

Training custom model: This is like giving the computer a special dictionary and grammar book for a particular field. The computer learns the unique words and how they're usually used.
Using DeepSpeech: This is a powerful tool that helps create these custom models. It's like having a smart teacher for the computer.

3 : Real-time Processing:

This is about understanding speech as it's happening, not after the whole recording is done. It's like having a super-fast translator working alongside you.

Streaming recognition: This means the computer starts figuring out what's being said even before you finish speaking. It's like guessing the end of someone's sentence, but more accurate.
WebSocket: This is a way for the computer to keep listening and updating its understanding continuously. It's like having a phone line always open between the speaker and the listener.

Multi-model Approach:

This method uses multiple "experts" to understand speech, instead of relying on just one. It's like asking several friends what they heard and then deciding what was actually said.

Multiple models: Each model is like a different expert, maybe one is good with accents, another with technical terms.
Voting system: This is how the computer decides which understanding is correct. If most "experts" agree on what was said, that's probably the right answer.

In the code, they use different speech recognition methods (like Google's and Sphinx) and then choose the most common result. It's like taking a poll among your expert friends to decide what was really said.
